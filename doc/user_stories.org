** Adding Samples

   - As an Analyst, I want to add samples from multiple internal (to
     WTSI) and/or external (to WTSI) studies to any single analysis. I
     want to add most, but not all samples from each.

   - As an Analyst, I want add samples whose data are in GTC (Illumina
     Genotype Call) format and/or IDAT (Illumina raw intensity) format
     to any single analysis.

   - As an Analyst, I want to accept samples from different suppliers
     that may have clashing sample identifiers, or no sample
     identifiers, to any single analysis while being able to
     distinguish their results.

   - As an Analyst, I want to accept samples from suppliers external
     (to WTSI) whose sample identifiers may contain non-ASCII
     characters and/or non-printable or ASCII control characters
     without the need to spend time renaming them.
