Components of the WTSI genotype analysis pipeline.

This is the perl Genotyping module, a component of the WTSI genotype
analysis pipeline which provides command-line applications. These
applications may be run manually or within a pipeline defined by the
Ruby Genotyping module.

This software uses Module::Build to build, test and install its Perl
packages.  In addition, the install_R target will install the
required R scripts.

To install Perl and R components of the pipeline:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build test
  ./Build install --install_base <target directory>
  ./Build install_config --install_base <target directory>
  ./Build install_R --install_base <target directory>
