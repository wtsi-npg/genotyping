Genotyping test datasets

Artificial test data in PLINK and SIM formats, created for tests of genotyping QC.

1) Dataset small_test

Plink data:
* Contains 100 samples and 210 SNPs.
* 100 SNPs are annotated as chromosome 1, and 110 from chromosome 23 (X).  Of the X chromosomes, 10 are from pseudoautosomal regions or PARs; these are annotated as X, but heterozygous on male samples.  The X and PAR SNPs allow gender testing.
* Genotype calls are randomly generated for each sample.  Probability of "no call" events is 5%.  Heterozygosity is 2% for male X sites (excluding PARs) and 25% otherwise.
* 5 duplicates have been deliberately inserted; the first 10 samples are actually 5 duplicate pairs.
* Sample names are in PLATE_WELL_ID format.  An 8 row by 12 column plate configuration was used.

SIM data:
* Same samples and genotype calls as PLINK data above.
* Intensities generated using signal and noise distributions.
* Written in .sim (simple intensity matrix) format

SQLite database:
* small_test.db is an appropriate SQLite database containing metadata for the above PLINK and .sim files.  Note that QC tests write to a temporary copy of the database, so that the "master" copy in qc_test_data is unaffected.

2) Generating new datasets

This is done as follows:
  1. Use src/python/create_test_data/bin/plinkGenerator.py to generate Plink data, in binary and non-binary versions. Run with --help for description of command-line options. Non-binary Plink data can then be removed, retaining the .bed, .bim and .map files.
  2. Run src/perl/bin/gendermix_standalone.pl to generate a sample_xhet_gender.txt file.
  3. Run src/perl/bin/create_test_database.pl to create the SQLite .db file.
  4. Run src/python/create_test_data/bin/simGenerator.py to create an appropriate .sim file.

The number of samples and other parameters can be set as required. Data will be correctly formatted, with randomly generated genotypes and intensities. By definition, it will not correspond to any biological sample, so there will be no issues of consent or confidentiality.

Note that the SNP set generated for the data does not correspond to any real set of probes. In particular, it does not correspond to the snpset name HumanOmni25-8v1 used as a placeholder in the SQLite database generated by create_test_database.pl. As of 2013-04-25 this does not cause any problem for pipeline QC tests.
