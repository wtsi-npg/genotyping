Dataset Alpha

Artificial test data in PLINK and SIM formats, created for tests of genotyping QC.

PLINK dataset Alpha:
* Contains 1000 samples and 210 SNPs.
* 100 SNPs are annotated as chromosome 1, and 110 from chromosome 23 (X).  Of the X chromosomes, 10 are from pseudoautosomal regions or PARs; these are annotated as X, but heterozygous on male samples.  The X and PAR SNPs allow gender testing.
* Genotype calls are randomly generated for each sample.  Probability of "no call" events is 5%.  Heterozygosity is 2% for male X sites (excluding PARs) and 25% otherwise.
* 5 duplicates have been deliberately inserted; the first 10 samples are actually 5 duplicate pairs.
* Sample names are in PLATE_WELL_ID format.  An 8 row by 12 column plate configuration was used.
* Generation script was plinkGenerator.py, in /nfs/users/nfs_i/ib5/mygit/concoct_genotype_data/python/bin/ as of 2012-07-05.

SIM data:
* Same samples and genotype calls as PLINK data above.
* Intensities generated using signal and noise distributions.
* Written in .sim (simple intensity matrix) format, see genotype-call on github
* Generation script was simGenerator.py, in /nfs/users/nfs_i/ib5/mygit/concoct_genotype_data/python/bin/ as of 2012-07-12.

SQLite database:
* alpha_pipeline.db is an appropriate SQLite database containing metadata for the above PLINK and .sim files.  Note that QC test write to a temporary copy of the database, so that the "master" copy in qc_test_data is unaffected.
