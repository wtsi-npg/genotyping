=head1 NAME

WTSI::NPG::Genotyping::GenderMarkerCall

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Extension of the WTSI::NPG::Genotyping::Call class to handle gender markers.
The input variant is required to be of the GenderMarker type. Includes methods
to determine whether the call is consistent with an X (female) or Y (male)
variant.
