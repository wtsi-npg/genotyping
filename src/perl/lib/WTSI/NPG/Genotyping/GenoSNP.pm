  Arg [1]    : filehandle
  Arg [2]    : arrayref of SNP hashes (see read_snp_json)
  Example    : $fh = write_gs_snps($fh, \@snps)
  Description: Write SNP annotation to a filehandle in the format
               expected by GenoSNP.

               Important: The integer in the second column is not
               the Beadpool number as specified in the GenoSNP docs.
               The value written is ($snp->{norm_id} % 100) + 1. This
               is to emulate the existing software (g2i). I have no idea
               why this is not the Beadpool number.
