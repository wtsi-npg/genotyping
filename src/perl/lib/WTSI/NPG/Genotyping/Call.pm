  Example    : $new_call = $call->merge($other_call)
  Description: Merge results of this call with another on the same SNP:
               - If the genotypes are identical, return $self unchanged.
               - If exactly one of the two calls is a 'no call', return the
               non-null call.
               - If two non-null genotypes are in conflict, return undef
  Returntype : WTSI::NPG::Genotyping::Call or undef
