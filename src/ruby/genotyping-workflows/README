Components of the WTSI genotype analysis pipeline.

This is the Ruby Genotyping module, a component of the WTSI genotype
analysis pipeline which provides the pipeline definitions. It defines
which external analytical programs are run, with what arguments and in
what order. The Percolate pipeline management application is required
to run the pipelines.
