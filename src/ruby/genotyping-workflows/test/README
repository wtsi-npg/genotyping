To run test workflow tests, the following steps must be performed:

Installation:

1) The Perl libraries in this repository must be installed and the Perl and R
   scripts must be available on the PATH.

2) The genotype callers Illuminus and GenoSNP must be available on the PATH.

3) The Gftools library must be installed (required by Illuminus and GenoSNP).

4) The format-shifting utility program genotype-call must be available on the
   PATH.

Test data acquisition:

5) A pipeline runtime database named 'genotyping.db' must be created using the
   Perl scripts ready_pipe.pl, ready_infinium.pl and/or ready_external.pl. This
   file must be copied to the test directory.

   This file cannot be distributed for reasons of data confidentiality.

Shell environment setup:

6) The environment variable BEADPOOL_MANIFEST must be set to the absolute path
   of the Infinium BeadPool manifest (.bpm.csv) file corresponding to the data
   described by the pipeline runtime database created in step 5.
