Components of the WTSI genotype analysis pipeline.

This is the R component of the above pipeline.  It currently exists as a 
collection of standalone scripts, not an R package.  In the pipeline, the 
R scripts are invoked by system calls within Perl wrapper scripts.  The 
Perl wrappers assume that the R scripts are available on the PATH 
environment variable.

R scripts are installed as part of the Perl installation process, using 
`./Build install_R --install_base $INSTALL_DIRECTORY'.  This copies the 
scripts to the bin subdirectory of $INSTALL_DIRECTORY.  The Perl tests 
executed by `./Build test' also test functionality of the R scripts, for 
example by confirming that the correct plots are output.
