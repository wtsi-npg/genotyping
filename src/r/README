Components of the WTSI genotype analysis pipeline.

This is the R component of the above pipeline.  It currently exists as a 
collection of standalone scripts, not an R package.  In the pipeline, the 
R scripts are invoked by system calls within Perl wrapper scripts.  The 
Perl wrappers assume that the R scripts are available on the PATH 
environment variable.

As part of the Perl installation process executed by `./Build install', 
the R scripts are copied to the bin subdirectory of the Perl installation 
directory.  The Perl tests executed by `./Build test' also test 
functionality of the R scripts, for example by confirming that the correct 
plots are output.
